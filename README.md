**Web Dev Evolution — Technical Summary**

This project demonstrates how core web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) work together inside a modern stack using React, Next.js, TypeScript, and SCSS.

**_🟦 HTML_**

HTML defines the structure and semantics of a webpage. It forms the DOM tree that React ultimately renders.

Key concepts:

    Structural elements: div, header, section, footer
    
    Semantics improve accessibility & SEO
    
    Forms, media, lists, and text elements
    
    DOM = browser’s representation of HTML
    
    Role in this project
    
    JSX is compiled into HTML DOM nodes
    
    Components map to HTML elements under the hood


**_🟩 CSS_**

CSS controls appearance, layout, and responsive behavior.

Key concepts:

    Box model, specificity, cascade
    
    Flexbox and Grid for modern layout
    
    Responsive units and media queries
    
    Transitions and animations
    
    Role in this project
    
    Styling done via SCSS modules
    
    Styles are scoped per component
    
    Variables, nesting, and modular structure


**_🟨 JavaScript_**

JavaScript powers behavior, state, and dynamic updates.

Key concepts:

Variables, data types, arrays, objects

Functions & arrow functions

Events and DOM interaction

Async/await and fetch

Modules (import/export)


**Stack Overview**

**_React_**

- Component-based UI

- Virtual DOM

JSX bridges JS + HTML

**_Next.js_**

- App routing

- Server Actions

- Server/Client components

- Optimized bundling

**_TypeScript_**

- Static types

- Safer components & validation

- Better tooling and autocompletion

**_SCSS_**

- Component-scoped styling

- Nesting, variables, cleaner structure


This stack mirrors real-world industry practices and shows how fundamental web technologies evolve into full applications.
